            <h3>Description</h3>
            <div class="section">
                <p>
                    Gollai Hågun Suni is a Chamoru dish originally made with taro leaves and coconut milk. 
                    Taro leaves are a little harder to find (unless you grow it or know someone) and, growing up, 
                    I have always had it with spinach instead. To best describe this dish, it is often eaten as a side 
                    dish next to the meats and fish. In Filipino culture, this is very much comparable to Laing (pronounced as lah-ing). 
                    Only, in Gollai Hågun Suni, traditionally the dish is naturally vegan and, I can honestly say, wholesome.”.
